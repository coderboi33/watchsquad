WatchSquad üìπ
WatchSquad is a real-time video calling platform built with a modern tech stack. This project aims to provide a seamless and high-quality communication experience for everyone. It's currently in the foundational stage, with many exciting features on the horizon.

üöÄ About The Project
This application is designed to be a simple yet powerful video-calling solution. It leverages WebSockets for real-time communication and is built on a high-performance Turborepo monorepo structure.

Built With
This project is made possible by these incredible technologies:

Monorepo: Turborepo

Frontend: Next.js

Backend: Express.js

Real-time Communication: Socket.IO

üîß Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm) installed on your system.

Node.js (v18 or later recommended)

npm

npm install npm@latest -g

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/coderboi33/watchsquad.git

Navigate to the project directory

cd watchsquad

Install all dependencies

npm install

Set up environment variables

You will need to create two environment files for the frontend and backend applications.

For the backend app (e.g., in apps/server), create a file named .env:

PORT=5000

For the frontend Next.js app (e.g., in apps/web), create a file named .env.local:

# The URL should point to your backend server
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

Note: For local development, http:// is typically used. Adjust to wss:// or ws:// if you have a specific setup for secure WebSockets.

Usage
Once the installation and setup are complete, you can run the application.

Run the development server for all apps from the root directory:

npm run dev

This command will start both the frontend and backend servers concurrently. Open your browser and navigate to the frontend URL (usually http://localhost:3000) to see the application in action.
